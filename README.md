- Node.js 14+ for the frontend dashboard
- Git for version control

### Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone this repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/winsitoruser/monitoring.git
cd monitoring
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Backend

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create and configure your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor and fill in your specific settings:

```
# Basic Configuration
ENVIRONMENT=development  # 'development' or 'production'
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL

# Notification Settings
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
ALERT_THRESHOLD=3  # Number of failures before sending an alert

# Monitoring Configuration
CHECK_INTERVAL=60  # Check interval in seconds

# API Settings
XENORIZE_API_URL=https://api.xenorize.com
XENORIZE_API_KEY=your_xenorize_api_key_here
CRYPTELLAR_API_URL=https://api.cryptellar.com
CRYPTELLAR_API_KEY=your_cryptellar_api_key_here
```

#### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

### Starting the Backend

```bash
# From the root directory
python main.py
```

You'll see output similar to this when the monitoring service starts:

```
[INFO] 2025-06-29 19:55:00 - Starting Xenorize & Cryptellar Monitoring Service
[INFO] 2025-06-29 19:55:01 - Initializing health check monitors
[INFO] 2025-06-29 19:55:02 - Connected to notification services
[INFO] 2025-06-29 19:55:03 - Monitoring service running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### Starting the Frontend

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm start
```

The React development server will start, and the dashboard will automatically open in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the Dashboard

### First-Time Setup

1. Click on the ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** icon in the sidebar
2. Enter your API URL and API Key
3. Save your settings

### Main Features

#### Server Connection Settings

The **Server Connection Settings** page allows you to configure and test connections to your various servers:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Server Connections**
2. Add a new server connection by clicking the '+' button
3. Fill in the required details:
   - Server Name: A friendly name for your server
   - Server Type: API, Web, Database, etc.
   - Hostname/IP: The server's address
   - Port: The port to connect on

- **Uptime Statistics**: See how reliable your services are

## üîß Customization

### Backend Customization

#### Adding Custom Health Checks

Create a new Python file in the `monitors` directory with your custom health check logic:

```python
# monitors/custom_monitor.py
from monitors.base import BaseMonitor

class CustomMonitor(BaseMonitor):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(name="My Custom Monitor", config=config)
    
    def check_health(self):
        # Your custom health check logic here
        # Return True if healthy, False if not
        return True
```

Then register your monitor in `main.py`:

```python
from monitors.custom_monitor import CustomMonitor

# Add this to the monitor initialization section
monitoring_system.add_monitor(CustomMonitor(config))
```

#### Integrating Exception Tracking

Add the exception tracking decorator to functions you want to monitor:

```python
from utils.exception_tracker import exception_handler

@exception_handler
def your_function():
    # Your code here will be monitored for exceptions
    pass
```

### Frontend Customization

#### Adding New Dashboard Widgets

You can create custom dashboard widgets by adding new components to the `src/components` directory.

#### Modifying the Theme

The theme settings are located in `src/utils/theme.js`. You can customize colors, fonts, and other styling properties.

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **API Keys**: Never commit your API keys to version control
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the dashboard to authorized personnel
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the monitoring system updated with the latest security patches
- **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS for all API communications

## üìö Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend Won't Start

- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify your `.env` file is correctly configured
- Look for error messages in the console output

#### Frontend Shows "Cannot Connect to API"

- Ensure the backend server is running
- Check that your API URL and API Key are correctly configured in settings
- Verify network connectivity between frontend and backend

#### No Telegram Notifications

- Confirm your Telegram Bot Token is correct
- Verify that your Chat ID is valid
- Check the backend logs for any Telegram API errors

### Logs

Logs are stored in the following locations:

- Backend: `monitoring.log` in the root directory
- Frontend: Check browser console for client-side logs
